# Data Folder

This project originally used five CSV files:

- `order_products.csv` (not included — exceeds GitHub’s upload limit)
- `departments.csv`
- `aisles.csv`
- `products.csv`
- `instacart_orders.csv`

Only `order_products.csv` is missing from this repository.  
To maintain consistency across all projects, this folder represents where all data files are stored.

If you're reviewing this project and would like access to the full dataset, feel free to contact me.  
The dataset was originally provided through TripleTen for educational use.
